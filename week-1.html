                <h2>Pros</h2>
                <p>I am really enjoying the Immersive course, and all the time we have to go over the course work, compared
                    to the time that we had together in the evening course. Not feeling rushed to get through material is
                    really nice.</p>

                <p>Having Tom Day come in on Wednesday and review Bootstrap 3 was great. Going through the Bootstrap documentation
                    and hearing his added tid-bits helped my understanding a lot more.</p>

                <h2>Cons</h2>
                <p>It would be nice to have an external-vertical display next to Jake, or who ever is presenting, and have 
                    a step by step (Step 1., Step 2., Step 3...) on how to set up, start, or do various tasks. I noticed a 
                    bunch of students having a hard time getting up and going with SASS on Friday and if we could have the
                    steps we need to perform in order to get it up and running, I think that would keep the class from getting 
                    behind or lost.
